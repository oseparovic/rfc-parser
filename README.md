# rfc-parser

A simple RFC date-time format detection library. Currently supports four commonly used RFC date-time formats on the web: 

* RFC3339 
* RFC822 
* RFC2822 
* RFC5322 

If you'd like to add support for more please feel free to submit a pull request. The regex for each RFC might not be inclusive or restrictive enough. If that is the case please let me know or submit an amendment. Thank you!
